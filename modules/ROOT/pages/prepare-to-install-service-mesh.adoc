Before you download and install Anypoint Service Mesh, ensure that you review and fulfill the software, licensing, and permissions and roles requirements. 

== Audience Requirements

Anypoint Service Mesh is developed using Istio and Kubernetes. Therefore, you must have a working knowledge of Istio and Kubernetes to install and use Anypoint Service Mesh.


== Software Requirements

Your Anypoint Service Mesh installation requires the following applications and Kubernetes environments:

* One of the following environments on which to run Kubernetes:
** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
** Amazon EKS
** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Install Istio with policy enforcement and telemetry enabled. 
+
For more information about how to install Istio with this configuration enabled, see <<install_Istio,Installing Istio>>.

== Hardware Requirements

Your Anypoint Service Mesh installation requires the following hardware configuration at a minimum:

* CPU: 4 cores
* Memory: 8 GBs


== Production Licensing and Trial Licensing Requirements

You require an Anypoint Service Mesh license to perform the installation in your production environment. The license that you obtain must contain the following entitlements:

* API Gateway: api-gateway
* Cluster: clustering

For evaluation purposes, you can request a trial version of Anypoint Service Mesh. The trial version limits the use of the product and is best suited for only exploring and learning the product. The trial version is not recommended for production use.

To obtain a trial or regular license key, contact your MuleSoft account representative or the MuleSoft sales team. 


== Permissions and Roles Requirements

Before you can use Anypoint Service Mesh, you must:
 
* Obtain the Organization Administrators role to access the client ID and client secret credentials.
* From *API Manager > Environment Information*, obtain the client ID and client secret credentials to provision the adapter. You can provision the adapter with:
+
** Organization credentials
+
If you provision the adapter with organization credentials, you can manage APIs on the specific adapter of that organization. 
** Environment credentials
+
If you specify environment credentials, you can manage APIs of only that environment. MuleSoft recommends that you use the environment credentials instead of the organization credentials. 
+
For more information about which permissions to use, see xref:api-manager::org-credentials-config-mule4.adoc#obtaining-credentials[obtaining credentials].
* Cluster-admin role access to the Kubernetes cluster (only required for installation process)
* If you have configured an external identity provider for your organization, create a user in Anypoint Platform with Exchange Contributors and Manage APIs Configuration roles. Anypoint Service Mesh does not support users residing on an external identity provider for tasks such as creating and discovering APIs.

== Ports, IPs, and Hostnames Whitelist Requirements

In your network, you might need to whitelist the hostnames and ports of external resources to allow Anypoint Service Mesh to communicate with the MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services.

== Installing Istio

You can install Istio 1.4.x or 1.5.x in your environment to support Anypoint Service Mesh. However, the Istio configuration for Anypoint Service Mesh differs based on the Istio version that you installed.

=== Install Istio 1.5.x

To install and configure Istio 1.5.x for Anypoint Service Mesh:

. Download Istio using the https://istio.io/docs/setup/[Istio documentation].
. Install Istio with the following configurations:
.. Enable the policy control flag:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
values:
  global:
    disablePolicyChecks: false
  components:
    policy:
      enabled: true
    sidecarInjector:
      enabled: true
----
.. Enable telemetry:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
values:
  prometheus:
    enabled: true
  telemetry:
    v1:
      enabled: true
    v2:
      enabled: false
components:
  citadel:
    enabled: true
  telemetry:
    enabled: true
----
The following example illustrates a full manifest: 
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
spec:
  profile: default
  components:
    policy:
      enabled: true
    sidecarInjector:
      enabled: true
    citadel:
      enabled: true
    telemetry:
      enabled: true
