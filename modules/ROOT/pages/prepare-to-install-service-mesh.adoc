Before you download and install Anypoint Service Mesh, ensure that you review and fulfill the software, licensing, and permissions and roles requirements. 

== Audience Requirements

Anypoint Service Mesh is developed using Istio and Kubernetes. Therefore, you must have a working knowledge of Istio and Kubernetes to install and use Anypoint Service Mesh.


== Software Requirements

Your Anypoint Service Mesh installation requires the following applications and Kubernetes environments:

* One of the following environments on which to run Kubernetes:
** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
** Amazon EKS
** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Install a supported version of Istio.
+
For more information about how to install, see <<install_Istio,Installing Istio>>.

== Hardware Requirements

Your Anypoint Service Mesh installation requires the following hardware configuration at a minimum:

* CPU: 4 cores
* Memory: 8 GBs


== Production Licensing and Trial Licensing Requirements

You require an Anypoint Service Mesh license to perform the installation in your production environment. The license that you obtain must contain the following entitlements:

* API Gateway: api-gateway
* Cluster: clustering

For evaluation purposes, you can request a trial version of Anypoint Service Mesh. The trial version limits the use of the product and is best suited for only exploring and learning the product. The trial version is not recommended for production use.

To obtain a trial or regular license key, contact your MuleSoft account representative or the MuleSoft sales team. 


== Permissions and Roles Requirements

Before you can use Anypoint Service Mesh, you must:
 
* Obtain the Organization Administrators role to access the client ID and client secret credentials.
* From *API Manager > Environment Information*, obtain the client ID and client secret credentials to provision the adapter:
** Provisioning the adapter with organization-level credentials enables you to manage all the APIs in every environment of your organization.
** Provisioning the adapter with environment-level credentials enables you to manage APIs of only that specific environment of your organization.
MuleSoft recommends that you use the environment credentials instead of the organization credentials. 
+
For more information about which permissions to use, see xref:api-manager::org-credentials-config-mule4.adoc#obtaining-credentials[obtaining credentials].
* Obtain the Cluster Administrator role to access the Kubernetes cluster (only required for installation process).
* If you have configured an external identity provider for your organization, create a xref:obtain-connected-apps-credentials.adoc[Connected App] in Anypoint Platform with Exchange Contributors and Manage APIs Configuration roles. Anypoint Service Mesh does not support users residing on an external identity provider for tasks, such as creating and discovering APIs.

== Ports, IPs, and Hostnames Allow list Requirements

In your network, you might need to add to the allow list the hostnames and ports of external resources to enable Anypoint Service Mesh to communicate with the MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services.
