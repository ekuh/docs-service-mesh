After you provision the adapter, you must create an API to bind to the service. 
//Give an example here and tell them why we need to do this.

To create an API, perform the following steps:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform > API Manager* and select the *Manage API* drop-down list. 
. Select *Create new API*.
+
The Creating an asset page is displayed.
. Specify the *Name*, and *Asset types* details for the API.  
+
The Endpoint Configuration window is displayed.
. In the *Managing type* field, select the *Basic Endpoint* radio button.
. In the *Application type* field, select the *Non-Mule application* radio button.
. Optionally, specify the *Implementation URI*, and click *Save*.
+
Your API is now created.
