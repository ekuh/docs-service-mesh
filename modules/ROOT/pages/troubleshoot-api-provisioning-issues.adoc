After you provision an adapter, you must create an API to bind the service to, which might require you to troubleshoot the following errors: 

* <<client-secret-incorrectly-configured,Incorrectly configured client secret>>
* <<provision-call-failed,API provisioning failure>>

[[client-secret-incorrectly-configured]]
== Incorrectly Configured Client Secret 

If using a secret when you create an API, you must verify that you are correctly referencing the secret.

=== Cause

If you provide incorrect credentials, the following error occurs:

image::credentials-error-api-prov-service-mesh.png[Credentials error when provisioning APIs]

=== Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue:

Describe your service instance using the `kubectl describe serviceinstance _api_instance_name_` command:
+
`$ kubectl describe serviceinstance inventory-resource-api`
In the `Status` field, a detailed description of the error is displayed:
+
image::error-with-params-error-display-api-prov-service-mesh.png[Error with parameters when provisioning APIs]

In the following example, an error occurred due to an extra comma in the stringData section that is provided after the password segment:

[source,text,linenums]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-credentials
  namespace: nto-payment
type: Opaque
stringData:
  user-pass:
    '{
      "user": "<user>",
      "password": "<password>",
    }'
----

=== Solution

To resolve this issue:

. Delete the API.
. Resolve the username and password error.
. Re-create the API.  


[[provision-call-failed]]
== API Provisioning Failure

When you provision an API by using Anypoint Service Mesh, the asset (in Exchange) and the API instance (in API Manager) might not be successfully created in Anypoint Platform.

=== Causes

This error can occur if you are attempting to:
 
* Re-create an asset in Exchange that was more than seven days old before being deleted
* Provision an API with invalid values


=== Diagnose

To diagnose this issue: 

. Run the `$ asmctl api list` command. 
+
The status of the API is displayed as `ProvisionCallFailed`. 
. Run the `asmctl api logs --name=<replace_with_api_name> --namespace=<replace_with_namespace>` command.
+
The following output illustrates provisioning an API with an invalid version:

. If no information is displayed, run the `kubectl describe serviceinstances <replace_with_api_name> -n <replace_with_namespace>` command.

The `status` section of the resource displays an error message explaining the issue: 

[source,text,linenums]
----
Error provisioning ServiceInstance of ClusterServiceClass (K8S: "1c3b2100-5cdc-49ea-9423-dd7170e674b4"
ExternalName: "anypoint-platform-api-instance") at ClusterServiceBroker "service-mesh-incluster-broker": Status: 410; ErrorMessage: Gone; Description: Error from Exchange: There is no asset matching given parameters. (ID: 79d0cc7f-9969-477b-816d-c822916c0290); ResponseError: <nil>' reason: ProvisionCallFailed
----

In this case, the error is caused by an attempt to re-create an asset in Exchange that was more than seven days old before being deleted. Because Exchange does not allow that operation, provide a new `assetId` to create a new asset.

=== Solution

To resolve this issue: 

. Delete your API: 
+
`asmctl api delete --name=<replace_with_api_name> --namespace=<replace_with_namespace>`
. Fix the error.
//Do we need to tell them how to fix the error?
. Re-create the API.
