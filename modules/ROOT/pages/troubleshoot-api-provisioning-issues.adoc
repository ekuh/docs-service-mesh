After you provision an adapter, you must create an API, to which you then bind the service. You encounter errors when you provision an API if you provide invalid credentials.
//Should I move this error to the Service errors topic and call the topic "API and Service Issues"?
//@ Toams can we pose this as if you encounter API Provisioning issues, check these: incorrect credentials, and so on.

== Credential Errors

When you create an API, you must provide valid username and password credentials.

=== Cause

If you provide incorrect credentials, the following error occurs:

image::credentials-error-api-prov-service-mesh.png[Credentials error when provisioning APIs]

=== Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue:

. Describe your service instance:
+
`$ kubectl describe serviceinstance inventory-resource-api`
In the `Status` field, a detailed description of the error is displayed:
+
image::error-with-params-error-display-api-prov-service-mesh.png[Error with parameters when provisioning APIs]

In the following example, an error occurred due to an extra comma in the stringData section that is provided after the password segment:

[source,text,linenums]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-credentials
  namespace: nto-payment
type: Opaque
stringData:
  user-pass:
    '{
      "user": "<user>",
      "password": "<password>",
    }'
----

=== Solution

To resolve this issue:

. Delete the API.
. Resolve the error with the username and password credentials.
. Re-create the API.
