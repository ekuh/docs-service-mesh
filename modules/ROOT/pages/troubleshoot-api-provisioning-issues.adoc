After you provision an adapter, you must create an API, to which you then bind the service. You encounter errors when you provision an API if you provide invalid credentials.

== Client Secret is Incorrectly Configured

If using a secret when you create an API, you must verify that you are correctly referencing the secret.

=== Cause

If you provide incorrect credentials, the following error occurs:

image::credentials-error-api-prov-service-mesh.png[Credentials error when provisioning APIs]

=== Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue:

. Describe your service instance using the `kubectl describe serviceinstance _api_instance_name_` command:
+
`$ kubectl describe serviceinstance inventory-resource-api`
In the `Status` field, a detailed description of the error is displayed:
+
image::error-with-params-error-display-api-prov-service-mesh.png[Error with parameters when provisioning APIs]

In the following example, an error occurred due to an extra comma in the stringData section that is provided after the password segment:

[source,text,linenums]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-credentials
  namespace: nto-payment
type: Opaque
stringData:
  user-pass:
    '{
      "user": "<user>",
      "password": "<password>",
    }'
----

=== Solution

To resolve this issue:

. Delete the API.
. Resolve the username and password error.
. Re-create the API.  


== Large API specification files

If provisioning an API with a large specification file (current limit is `550KB`), you should create the API manually through the Anypoint Platform.

=== Cause

If you use a large file, the following errors might show when listing `service-mesh` namespace's pods:

image::large-api-error-oom-pod.png[Pod restarted due to out of memory error]
image::large-api-error-crashloop-backoff-pod.png[Pod restarted due to crashloop backoff error]

Or when inspecting the Service Catalog logs, an error of this kind:

[source,text,linenums]
----
E0605 21:13:58.080886       1 controller_instance.go:1968] ServiceInstance "default/flights-api-v1" v8611662: Failed to update status: rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = trying to send message larger than max (2554151 vs. 2097152)
I0605 21:13:58.080907       1 controller.go:408] Dropping ServiceInstance "default/flights-api-v1" out of the queue: rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = trying to send message larger than max (2554151 vs. 2097152)
----

=== Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue:

. Run this command and check the status of the Service Catalog pods:
+
`$ kubectl get pods -n service-mesh`
+ 
If the status is different from `Running`, the Service Catalog pods are probably failing because lack of resources. We will need to increment the limits of both pods and delete the service instance afterwards.

. If the pod is running correctly, check the logs for `rpc` errors:
+
`$ kubectl logs -f deployment/service-mesh-catalog-controller-manager -n service-mesh --tail=250 | grep "rpc error"`

=== Solution

To resolve this issue:

. If Service Catalog pods are failing, first increase their resource limits:
+
`$ kubectl -n service-mesh set resources deployment service-mesh-catalog-controller-manager --limits=memory=64Mi`
+
`$ kubectl -n service-mesh set resources deployment service-mesh-catalog-webhook --limits=memory=64Mi`
. Delete the service instance.
. Create the API through the Anypoint Platform.
