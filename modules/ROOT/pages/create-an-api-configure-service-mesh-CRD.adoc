After you provision the adapter, you must create an API to bind to the service. The following diagram illustrates the flow for creating an API:

//image::configure-service-mesh-flowchart-2.png[]
image::create-API-CRD-flowchart.png[]

You can create an API using Anypoint Platform or Anypoint Service Mesh:

* <<create-api-AP, Create an API using Anypoint Platform>>
+
If you want to create REST or SOAP APIs with OAS or WSDL definition, use Anypoint Platform.
+
Note that if you want to upload a REST API or OAS asset type, use a .json or .yaml file. Alternatively, if you want to upload a SOAP API or WSDL asset type, use a .wsdl or .xml file.
* <<create_api-CRD, Create an API using Anypoint Service Mesh Autocreate>>
+
Anypoint Service Mesh enables you to automatically create an HTTP API in Anypoint Platform, with no REST or SOAP definitions. You do not have to manually log in to Anypoint Platform. 
+
If you automatically create REST or SOAP APIs with Anypoint Service Mesh, the APIs are still managed internally as an HTTP asset without any definition.

[[create-api-AP]]
== Create an API Using Anypoint Platform

To create an API using Anypoint Platform, perform the following steps:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform > API Manager* and select the *Manage API* drop-down list. 
. Select *Create new API*.
+
The Creating an asset page is displayed.
. Specify the *Name*, and *Asset types* details for the API.  
+
Your Asset is now created in Exchange for reuse. After you create the Asset, you are now ready to perform Endpoint configuration.
+
The Endpoint Configuration window is displayed.
. In the *Managing type* field, select the *Basic Endpoint* radio button.
. In the *Application type* field, select the *Non-Mule application* radio button.
. Optionally, specify the *Implementation URI*, and click *Save*.
+
Your API is now created.

[[create_api-CRD]]
== Create an API Using Anypoint Service Mesh

Use the procedure in this section to automatically create an API using Anypoint Service Mesh. Before you create the API, you must complete the task prerequisite.

*Task Prerequisite*

Ensure that you obtain the environment ID and organization ID. You can perform this task from either API Manager or from Access Management. 

You require the Manage APIs Configuration permission for the environment where you are creating the API Instance and Exchange Contributor permission for the Business group where you are creating the asset.

To create an API in Anypoint Platform using Anypoint Service Mesh:

. Create your adapter definition file and save it with a '.yaml' file extension, for example `test-api.yaml`:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: <api name> # example: orders-api
  namespace: <namespace name> # example: default
  labels: 
    service-mesh.mulesoft.com/kind: api
spec:
  clusterServiceClassExternalName: anypoint-platform-api-instance
  clusterServicePlanExternalName: service-mesh
  parameters:
    environmentId: <environment ID> # example: 7cea45c6-3237-464d-bd34-3122c4abde29
    groupId: <group ID> # example: 350b8164-e809-4091-91f5-079fb30e5a1e
    assetId: <asset ID> # example: orders-api
    version: <version> # example: 0.0.1
    instanceLabel: <instance label> # example: public
    tags:
      apiSpec:
      - <tag in Exchange asset> # example: orders
      apiInstance:
      - <tag in API Manager instance> # example: orders
    user: <Username of the Anypoint Platform user>
    password: <Password of the Anypoint Platform user>
----
. Apply the CRD file using the following command:
`kubectl apply -f test-api.yaml`
. Verify the API status using the following command:
`asmctl api list`
+
The API that was created is displayed.
. Optionally, you can verify that an asset is created on Exchange and an API is created on API Manager.

== Reference Kubernetes Secret

Anypoint Service Mesh supports the use of Kubernetes secrets to store and manage sensitive information, such as your user credentials.

To store your user credentials in Kubernetes secrets:

. Create a CRD with the following Kubernetes secret details in a .yaml file, for example `user-secret.yaml`:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-credentials
  namespace: nto-payment
type: Opaque
stringData:
  user-pass:
    '{
      "user": "<user>",
      "password": "<password>"
    }'
----
. Apply the CRD using the following command:
+
`kubectl apply -f user-secret.yaml`
+
If the secret is correctly applied, a “secret/my-credentials configured” message is displayed. 
+
. Reference the secret in your API CRD, instead of the user and password parameters, as illustrated in the following example:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: inventory-resource-api
  namespace: nto-payment
  labels: 
    service-mesh.mulesoft.com/kind: api
spec:
  clusterServiceClassExternalName: anypoint-platform-api-instance
  clusterServicePlanExternalName: service-mesh
  parameters:
    environmentId: 28f63f07-7422-44f4-9e95-a85fa58f8e9c
    groupId: 380c89c6-8421-4c66-85b3-80336d9cb1ca
    assetId: inventory-api
    version: 1.0.0
    instanceLabel: public
    tags:
      apiSpec:
      - spec1
      apiInstance:
      - spec2
  parametersFrom:
  - secretKeyRef:
      name: my-credentials
      key: user-pass
