After you configure Service Mesh, you can manage both Mule and non-Mule applications from Anypoint API Manager, including applying policies to secure your microservices.

For example, you can apply the Rate Limiting policy to define the number of requests that you want your service to receive within a specified period of time.

To apply policies:

. Navigate to *API Manager* and select the specific API instance.
. From the left navigation, *select Policies > Apply New Policy*.
