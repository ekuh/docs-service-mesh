`curl -Ls http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/servicemesh/xapi/v1/install > service-mesh && chmod +x service-mesh`

The Anypoint Service Mesh client is now downloaded on your file system.

== Install Anypoint Service Mesh

When you invoke the installer, Istio, Service Catalog, Anypoint Service Mesh Broker, and ClusterIP Service components are installed in your Kubernetes cluster. The installer performs several steps as part of the installation, such as checking for dependencies and performing various configurations.

=== Install with Proxy

If you need to install Anypoint Service Mesh in a proxy environment, provide the proxy configuration during the installation. 

. In the location from which you downloaded your Anypoint Service Mesh client, type:
+
`./service-mesh install --clientId=<clientId> --clientSecret=<clientSecret> --license=<license absolute or relative path> --platformUri=<Anypoint Platform Uri> --proxyHost=<host> --proxyProtocol=<protocol> --proxyPort=<port> --proxyUser=<proxy username> --proxyPassword=<proxy password>`

=== Configure Headers for Client Authorization-based Policies

Anypoint Service Mesh is configured with minimized whitelisted headers for client-based policies:

- jwt
- authorization
- client_id
- client-id
- client_secret
- client-secret

Before use, you must whitelist a custom header. Because header whitelisting is performed at the cluster level, you do not need to whitelist headers for every managed API.

To whitelist a header, run the following command:

`./service-mesh management config header-whitelist --name=<header name>`

For example, if you want to allow the use of header `x-client-secret`, run:

`./service-mesh management config header-whitelist add --name=x-client-secret`

To list the whitelisted headers, run the following command:

`./service-mesh management config header-whitelist list`
